Doing hair -regardless of the art type- has always been an interesting topic to talk about among artists; due to its daunting challenges on the way. No matter what type of 3D hair you're creating (real-time, rendered or sculpted), the way of thinking about it, the concept, is the same.

Let me make it clear at this point that if you're looking for quality output, there's no fast ways around it, you have to be patient and spend your time, deal with it; period.

Now, I'm not gonna write any step-by-step guides, because you can find loads of them on Google, and good ones, too. However, I'm here to talk about how to catch a fish, rather than giving you only one fish.

_This article is written because one of my_ [_Reddit_](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterArtists/ "Reddit - r/CharacterArtists") _subscribers asked me about some explanations on doing hair. Due to the loads of work and lack of time, I couldn't create the images of this article myself. So the images shown in the context, are other pro artists' works (I've done some paint-overs though) and I have no claims on them._

### The Right Way To Think About Doing Hair As An Artist

The basic idea, is to think of it as a sculpting process. Meaning that you have to do the primary forms first, then nail down the secondary shapes and finally the tertiary details. I'm gonna explain about each one and how to figure out each pass. As I said before, it doesn't matter what sort of 3D hair you're creating. This way of thinking, applies to all.

_First, gather a bunch of references and put them in a single canvas in Photoshop. Then try to study them by painting over. The goals are clear: to break the reference into smaller shapes. The overall volume and silhouette is translated as the primary forms,_

##### Primary Forms

The primary forms, are the first step (after gathering and studying references which I'm gonna talk about in a bit) of doing hair. If you ask about a clearer definition, I'll put it this way: "The Primary forms of hair, are the ones which define the overall volume of the hair, and the general silhouette (forget about the tiny fly-away hairs for now). The ones that are recognized by the audience if your character is in the darkness and there's some light behind."

The goal of this pass, is simply to cover most of the head and let no scalp skin be visible. Besides, to show the general recognizable hairstyle.

* If you're doing real-time hair, you're gonna need a texture sheet that does have some thick groups of hair, so that it let almost no light through and cover the scalp skin.
* If you're using hair-groomers like XGen, it's the same; depending on your desired hairstyle, you'll need at least one separate description to cover the head and shape the general silhouette.
* If you're sculpting hair, it's still the same; you have to somewhat forget about details and nail down the primary shapes.
