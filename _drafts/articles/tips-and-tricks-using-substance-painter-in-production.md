_Substance Painter_ is firmly integrated into pipelines of many animation/VFX studios around the world. As a texturing/look development artist in those studios, you have to tackle _SP_ on a daily basis. I've been doing it, and decided to share 10 tips and tricks I picked up along the way. 

 1. Work Non-Destructively

    The first one is really important, actually. You have to be flexible in terms of art-dircetion, maybe trying different looks rather quickly. To achieve that, you need to have control over every visual element you put on the screen. The best way to do it in my opinion, is to let _masking_ be in charge wherever you can. For example, instead of painting on a height channel, try painting a mask for a fill layer with height slider to control the depth whenever you want. You get the idea.
 2. Create Your Own Library

    Down the production pipeline, you will probably need the unique look you are spending your time on right now. Also sometimes there might be a gap between working on two similar assets. So try to create a library for yourself. Like you could save a smart material everytime you finish a new asset to develop a good habit.
 3. Create Your Own Output Template

    Depending on your SP shader and target rendering engine, you may need to add or remove exported maps. It's better to save multiple templates for different situations. It keeps the consistency in the project.
 4. Don't underestimate Anchorpoints

    You can use anchor point to create complicated setups. Or simply use it to add extra cavity on the go.
 5. Keep Everything Organized

    Always prepare the files as if another artist would continue from tomorrow on, even if you know that's not the case. By doing so, your files will be readable, editable and reusable by anyone in a robust manner. By not keeping organized, you would lose track of the project sooner or later. No need to mention how confused other artists who will work on the project would be.

 7. Check On Every Channel Separately
