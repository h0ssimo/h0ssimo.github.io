_Substance Painter_ is firmly integrated into pipelines of many animation/VFX studios around the world. As a texturing/look development artist in those studios, you have to tackle _SP_ on a daily basis. I've been doing it, and decided to share 10 tips and tricks I picked up along the way. 

1. Work Non-Destructively

   The first one is really important, actually. You have to be flexible in terms of art-dircetion, maybe trying different looks rather quickly. To achieve that, you need to have control over every visual element you put on the screen. The best way to do it in my opinion, is to let _masking_ be in charge wherever you can. For example, instead of painting on a height channel, try painting a mask for a fill layer with height slider to control the depth whenever you want. You get the idea.
2. Create Your Own Library

   Down the production pipeline, you will probably need the unique look you are spending your time on right now. Also sometimes there might be a gap between working on two similar assets. So try to create a library for yourself. Like you could save a smart material everytime you finish a new asset to develop a good habit.
3. Create Your Own Output Template
4. Don't underestimate Anchorpoints
5. Keep Everything Organized
6. Substance Painter Is A Preview
7. Check On Every Channel Separately
8.
