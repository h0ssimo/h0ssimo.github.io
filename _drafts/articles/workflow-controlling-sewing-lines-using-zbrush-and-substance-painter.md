Having control over the sewing lines you sculpt in your character's clothing, is crucial; because when it comes to texturing part of the pipeline, it will be important to be able to deal with them separate from the main clothing. By using this workflow, you can assign different color, material, dirt, etc. to the sewing lines separately, in Substance Painter.

### The Concept

The whole idea, is simply to create a mask while sculpting in ZBrush. Then, when you import your model to Substance Painter, it's just a matter of applying the created mask to the desired material. And BOOM! You are in the driving seat!

This showcased workflow, could be used for any sorts of similar things, like zippers; then you can assign metal material to that section in Substance Painter.

### Important Notes Before Starting

* Your mesh has to have proper UVs.
* We create the mask while sculpting, so if you already have your sculpt ready, this is not gonna work, naturally.
* If you needed to change/optimize the mesh's UVs after doing the sculpture, there's nothing to worry about. The mask will be projected to your new mesh along with the sculpting details.
