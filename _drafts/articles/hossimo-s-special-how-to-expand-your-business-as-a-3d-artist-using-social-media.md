If you're stuck professionally at some point in your career as an artist in general, it's not all your fault. You can be a good _3d modeler, painter_, _sculptor_ or _texturing artist_ and still not getting the deserved recognition. Of course having a strong portfolio is quite essential, so still try to get better on a daily basis; but it's only half the way, if not less! Business-wise, there's not much point at having some amazing artworks where no one can really see them, or nobody knows why they may actually need your skills in their projects. That's where _Marketing_ and _Business Plans_ come in.

**_\~dissclaimer:_** as I mentioned earlier, the ideas in this article are my mere _suggestions._ So it may not apply to your professional style. In either case, I keep my fingers crossed that somebody out there find this article helpful. :)

**What's the Goal?**

If we're talking about any kind of serious business on which you can rely for lifetime, in my opinion, there must be a nice balance between your art and monetizing on your art or skills. (perfect balance are extremely rare, if at all)

You have to grow financially as individual, so considering you have your artworks ready, in this article we're gonna discuss on how you may monetize. After all, a successful business plan is the one which puts you in a nice starting point and ready to expand. So that's clear.

**What's the Plan?**

With the appropriate portfolio in hand as an artist, you probably would be glad on your first job landing in a big-production VFX / Animation company. But from the wider angle of the big picture, you actually need a small but nice community more than anything else to back you up. Once you have the community, it's about leading them to the right direction.

_Right direction,_ meaning getting your community from point **A** to **B** -adding value to the community, that's **_the key_**- and keeping the flow in the right direction.

### How to Build a Community?

  
While there are lots of _social media platforms_ out there that you are probably already a member of, it's all about getting people to come back more and more on a regular basis. Grabbing their attention. And that's only possible by **_adding value_** to your audience as an artist. Values may differ from a person to another; but the the thing is, they are all, well, _valuable_!  
To start, I'd suggest starting out with a _personal website._ That gives you lots of opportunities. Other than introducing yourself and putting a nice _portfolio_ online, you should use it as the head quarters of your _own brand._ People who visit your website, **_must_** get to know who you are, what you do, and what you have to offer in a nice way.  
People whose wavelength would match your content, will always want to know more about you and your business. So make sure you are prepared for that. Create a _platform_ for them to gather together and share thought and knowledge. Some people prefer Discord, some people prefer Reddit and even Telegram, YouTube, Instagram and other social media platforms. It depends on what you want to propose to them.

What Can You Really Propose?

  
I mean, there are a lot of opportunities, but what are we really talking about?  
The field of _CGI_ is so vast that it takes a huge effort just to scratch the surface.  
Here are some activities you can do to try to **_make a difference._**

##### Podcasts

If you're passionate about the field you are trying to develop as an artist and individual human being, you may have a lot of to talk about. So why not sharing your thoughts with the people who are already interested in what you do? Make it easier for them to literally hear from you!

#####   
Articles and Blogs

_Written_ articles and posts, are perfect for contents that need to be _referenced_ or _bookmarked_ for later usages by your audience. Some _walkthroughs_ are also easier to get back to, when written. So have that in mind, just take your time and transfer your knowledge carefully through written words.  
Also, in a more relaxed _Blog_ environment, you could always share stuff related to your _lifestyle._ I mean, what it takes to be _you_?

#####   
Reviews and Critiques

Have you watched a recent _PIXAR_ movie that you liked? Or some goofy _VFX_ on the weekend? Maye a _video game_ you just finished playing? Come tell people what you think about them and what makes a movie or a featured animated movie or mostly a video game, a better one, from your perspective as a _professional._  
If you are a musician or painter, it doesn't matter, it still applies. It's a human thing that were interested in other people's opinions. We're social beings anyways.   
  
Tutorials and Free Goodies  
Remember how you had to search everywhere some years ago to find the free brush / alpha / texture or model you needed? Now it's all much easier to find. Though professional-grade quality digital assets are still extremely challenging to find. So let's try to make the world a better place by sharing the knowledge and tools for the community to expand and grow and prosper. Much as like as we all did in human evolution across history. Learn from others and pass it down for the yearning.  
  
Videos  
You can use videos for almost any purpose. You could try going live with other professional artists or just quickly pointing out the tip or trick of the day. Lots of ground to cover here. The choice is yours. But whatever you do, do it in a style that you wished people had created when you were a student. Again, add values. Don't forget that.  
  
Artworks  
If you're going to fill your social media only with your artworks, it's totally fine. Just make sure you have the stability and constant online presence for that's another key in online marketing. So this usually means speed. You need to be fast enough to ensure you deliver some quality artworks in just 1 or 2 days. So I think most 3D artists and animators and traditional sculptors out of the game! Maybe some 2D artists or prototype concept artists would find this option suitable.  
  
Consider Taking Polls and Q&A  
Sometimes a question answerd to an art student, could mean a lot to them, therefore, create value for them. So why not doing that time to time?  
Also since we're interested in other people's opinions as social beings, taking polls and asking your audience for their opinion about various subjects would keep everyone happy and curiosities satisfied!
