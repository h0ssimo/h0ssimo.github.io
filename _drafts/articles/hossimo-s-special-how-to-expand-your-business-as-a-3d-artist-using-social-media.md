If you're stuck professionally at some point in your career as an artist in general, it's not all your fault. You can be a good _3d modeler, painter_, _sculptor_ or _texturing artist_ and still not getting the deserved recognition. Of course having a strong portfolio is quite essential, so still try to get better on a daily basis; but it's only half the way, if not less! Business-wise, there's not much point at having some amazing artworks where no one can really see them, or nobody knows why they may actually need your skills in their projects. That's where _Marketing_ and _Business Plans_ come in.

**_\~dissclaimer:_** as I mentioned earlier, the ideas in this article are my mere _suggestions._ So it may not apply to your professional style. In either case, I keep my fingers crossed that somebody out there find this article helpful. :)

**What's the Goal?**

If we're talking about any kind of serious business on which you can rely for lifetime, in my opinion, there must be a nice balance between your art and monetizing on your art or skills. (perfect balance are extremely rare, if at all)

You have to grow financially as individual, so considering you have your artworks ready, in this article we're gonna discuss on how you may monetize. After all, a successful business plan is the one which puts you in a nice starting point and ready to expand. So that's clear.

**What's the Plan?**

With the appropriate portfolio in hand as an artist, you probably would be glad on your first job landing in a big-production VFX / Animation company. But from the wider angle of the big picture, you actually need a small but nice community more than anything else to back you up. Once you have the community, it's about leading them to the right direction.

_Right direction,_ meaning getting them from point **A** to **B** -adding value to the community, that's **_the key_**-
