If you're stuck professionally at some point in your career as an artist in general, it's not all your fault. You can be a good _painter_, _sculptor_ or _texturing artist_ and still not getting the deserved recognition. Of course having a strong portfolio is quite essential, so still try to get better on a daily basis; but it's only half the way, if not less! Business-wise, there's not much point at having some amazing artworks where no one can really see them, or nobody knows why they may actually need your skills in their projects. That's where _Marketing_ and _Business Plans_ come in.
