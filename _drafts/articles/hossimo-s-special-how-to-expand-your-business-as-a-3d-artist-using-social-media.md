If you're stuck professionally at some point in your career as an artist in general, it's not all your fault. You can be a good _3d modeler, painter_, _sculptor_ or _texturing artist_ and still not getting the deserved recognition. Of course having a strong portfolio is quite essential, so still try to get better on a daily basis; but it's only half the way, if not less! Business-wise, there's not much point at having some amazing artworks where no one can really see them, or nobody knows why they may actually need your skills in their projects. That's where _Marketing_ and _Business Plans_ come in.

**_\~dissclaimer:_** as I mentioned earlier, the ideas in this article are my mere _suggestions._ So it may not apply to your professional style. In either case, I keep my fingers crossed that somebody out there find this article helpful. :)

**What's the Goal?**

If we're talking about any kind of serious business on which you can rely for lifetime, in my opinion, there must be a nice balance between your art and monetizing on your art or skills. (perfect balance are extremely rare, if at all)

You have to grow financially as individual, so considering you have your artworks ready, in this article we're gonna discuss on how you may monetize. After all, a successful business plan is the one which puts you in a nice starting point and ready to expand with some extra cash to grow the business in a constructive way. So that's clear.

**What's the Plan?**

With the appropriate portfolio in hand as an artist, you probably would be glad on your first job landing in a big-production VFX / Animation company. But from the wider angle of the big picture, you actually need a small but nice community more than anything else to back you up. Once you have the community, it's about leading them to the right direction.

_Right direction,_ meaning getting your community from point **A** to **B** -adding value to the community, that's **_the key_**- and keeping the flow / traffic of your ever-growing community in the right direction, which benefits everyone involved.

### How to Build a Community?

  
While there are lots of _social media platforms_ out there that you are probably already a member of, it's all about getting people to come back more and more on a regular basis. Grabbing their attention. And that's only possible by **_adding value_** to your audience as an artist. _Values_ may differ from a person to another; but the the thing is, they are all, well, _valuable_!  
To start, I'd suggest starting out with a _personal website._ That gives you lots of opportunities. Other than introducing yourself and putting a nice _portfolio_ online, you should use it as the head quarters of your _own brand._

People who visit your website, **_must_** get to know who you are, what you do, and what you have to offer in a nice stylish way.  
People whose wavelength would match your content, will always want to know more about you and your business. So make sure you are prepared for that. Create a _platform_ for them to gather together and share thought and knowledge. Some people prefer Discord, some people prefer Reddit and even Telegram, YouTube, Instagram and other social media platforms. It depends on what you want to propose to them.

####   
What Can You Really Propose?

  
I mean, there are a lot of opportunities, but what are we really talking about?  
The field of _CGI_ is so vast that it takes a huge effort just to scratch the surface.  
Here are some activities you can do to try to **_make a difference_** and **_stand out_** in your community.

##### Podcasts

If you're passionate about the field you are trying to develop as an artist and individual human being, you may have a lot of to talk about. So why not sharing your thoughts with the people who are already interested in what you do? Make it easier for them to literally hear from you!

#####   
Articles and Blogs

_Written_ articles and posts, are perfect for contents that need to be _referenced_ or _bookmarked_ for later usages by your audience. Some _walkthroughs_ are also easier to get back to, when written. So have that in mind, just take your time and transfer your knowledge carefully through written words.  
Also, in a more relaxed _Blog_ environment, you could always share stuff related to your _lifestyle._ I mean, what it takes to be _you_?

#####   
Reviews and Critiques

Have you watched a recent _PIXAR_ movie that you liked? Or some goofy _VFX_ on the weekend? Maye a _video game_ you just finished playing? Come tell people what you think about them and what makes a movie or a featured animated movie or mostly a video game, a better one, from your perspective as a _professional._  
If you are a musician or painter, it doesn't matter, it still applies. It's a human thing that were interested in other people's opinions. We're social beings anyways. 

#####   
Tutorials and Free Goodies

Remember how you had to search everywhere some years ago to find the _free brush_ / _alpha_ / _texture_ or _3d model_ you needed? Now it's all much easier to find. Though professional-grade quality digital assets are still extremely challenging to find. So let's try to make the world a better place by sharing the knowledge and tools for the community to expand and grow and prosper. Much as like as we all did in human evolution across history. _Learn from others and pass it down for the yearning._

#####   
Videos

You can use videos for almost _any_ purpose. You could try going _live_ with other professional artists or just quickly pointing out the _tip_ or _trick_ of the day. Lots of ground to cover here. The choice is yours. But whatever you do, do it in a **_style _**that you wished people had created when you were a student. Again, **_add values_**. Don't forget that.

#####   
Artworks

If you're going to fill your social media _only_ with your artworks, it's totally fine. Just make sure you have the stability and _constant online presence_ for that's another **_key_** in _online marketing_ as _artists_. So this usually means **_high quality/time ratio_**. You need to be fast enough to ensure you deliver some quality artworks in just 1 or 2 days. So I think most _3D artists_ and _animators_ and _traditional sculptors_ are ruled out of the game! Maybe _2D artists_ or _prototype concept artists_ would find this option more suitable.

#####   
Consider Taking Polls and Q&A

Sometimes a question answerd to an art student, could mean a lot to them, therefore, **_create value_** for them. So why not doing that time to time?  
Also since we're interested in other people's opinions as social beings, _taking polls_ and asking your audience for their opinion about various subjects would keep everyone happy and curiosities satisfied!

##### Sharing Playlists, Watchlists, Must-Play Video Games

As always it may be curious for some people in your community to know what your top favorite list is. It's also nice to share some _Spotify_ playlists with the creative people around the globe! Like what do you listen to when you work? If you listen to any, of course.

Or what are the most nostalgic games you've ever played? The list could go on and on. I'm just hoping to give you enough insights to stand on your own feet.

### What's Next?

So after some social interaction, contribution and networking like we discussed, now you have the required power to start your engines! But that's just the beginning; _can you really drive?_

See, what's important is to _decide_ \[correctly, or as you desire\] when you have to choose between paths in your career. You can also choose not to decide, but that has it's own price, too; so evaluate everything.

There's another great factor when it comes to moving something forward, which is _stability_. You need to take care of your _online presence_ on a daily and weekly schedule. Not all the time of course, but based on a _schedule_.

These are **_-schedule and stability-_** the things that actually move your _campaign_ forward. So first have a _schedule_, and then _stabilize_ your daily routines. Build good habits. And of course have some tolerance percentage over your time management based on your personal lifestyle.

### The Monetizing Plans For CGI Artists

Finally, the part we've all been waiting for! Now, this topic is very vast, but I'm gonna go cover as much as possible. So I'm gonna divide them between sections.

##### First, Why We Do This? There Are Already A Lot Out There!

Let's talk about this a little bit. No it's not; from a producer's point of view, there's not as much content available as you'd expect out there in terms of _quality_ on the _market_. Also there are _surprisingly few_ artists in the business who developed both **_artistic_** and **_technical_** skills in the same balance and strength. So there's always room for us if we're really good. That's that.

Now, asking money for a service, whether arts-related or not, is only natural, and it simply means _business_. So, be confident, focus on your own **_skills_** and **_knowledge_,** _lead_ interested people in your _community_, and help them get one step closer to bringing their dreams to life, and they will understand and find it totally fine to pay a _fair_ amount for what they get from _you_ and your _premium services_. They also know that you have families to feed.

So, be aware of the facts and reality, and take your steps carefully throughout your career and _personal branding_.

##### Then, Comes The First Decision

You probably have an _smartphone_ or already are reading this on a _smartphone_ anyways, so you're familiar with mobile apps and games. If you have noticed, there are three types of games or apps: **_paid,_** **_free_ (with in-app purchases)** and **_free_** ones. We will leave free ones aside since we covered it in _Tutorials and Free Goodies_ sections. So now there's two options: either go for **Direct Business**, or to keep everything available for free for all, try **_Getting Sponsorships_** to back your finances.

You may come up with another plan, or a mix of both; but I just wanted to point out that this is the sort of mindset most artists don't seem to have. Just consider that as a real thing, clarify your plans for yourself first.

#### Different Options For Different Tastes

##### YouTube

_\~Getting Sponsorship_

So in this one you need to add value to your community who follow your profession as a career, through videos. There are a lot of ideas to go for this one. You need to nail the sense of time efficiency to your audience after the close your video. They should be saving their time by watching your videos. That's what brings them back for more. At some point when you got enough views, could go for ad-based revenues provided by YouTube.

Have a distinct layout and color palette for your channel and video presentations, along with your favorite topic in CGI Industry, be patient and reap your rewards as a confirmation of doing your part right.

##### Instagram

_\~Getting Sponsorship_

On Instagram, it's a little bit different. I would say you could share your WIPs, or throw some hints about the projects you are currently working on. Also you could try sharing the stuff that evokes life as an artist lifestyle the way you see fit. It could be really anything to keep your online presence with all the stories and IG TVs and everything.

You could also choose between commission work offers if you are open to them. Another plan would be going for short _"What I Learned Today"_ series in your story highlights. Or daily posts and IG TV tutorials about what you're good at.

It's nice to mention that you could use services like linktr.ee or linkin.bio to manage your link in bio a lot better.

##### Podcasts

_\~Getting Sponsorship_

This one is really great for movie/game talks, tips and ticks on your career as artist, interviews with people in the industry, etc. If you feel like it, poetry and literature as season-based episodes to have a nice additional collection along with CGI art or whatever medium you are working in. Again, just to give you insights.

After a while, you could start emailing related companies who may be interested in Sponsorship, and find your way in. Or like YouTube, go ad-base.

Of the best platforms out there to reach out for, I could name Castbox, Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music and more.

##### Live Shows and Streaming

_\~Getting Sponsorship_

You could choose between Twitch, YouTube, Instagram, even Clubhouse and similar platforms to go online and reach out for your audience for various purposes. For example, you could obviously go for some live sculpting techniques, or maybe go live for hyping a new product or service you are going to launch. Setting up a Clubhouse room for a Q&A about a new tutorial you are going to release is also very helpful.

On Instagram you could share your lifestyle moments as well, like going live a few minutes before you do a bungee jump! Just mentioned this case to showcase the variation of use cases of a live stream.

If possible, another option would be going live along with industry veterans and successful people who could be inspirational for your community. By doing so, you might also provide the ultimate answer to the question "What does a VFX magician really look like?" lol

##### LinkedIn

_\~Direct Business_

LinkedIn has its own purposes and use cases. I would suggest going for what they actually created this platform for. In my opinion, there are a few focal points which you should consider.

Showcase your professional life in a single page, much like a CV, but with the power of referencing links to your projects, portfolio and awards. Engaging in community and trying to share related articles to try to help other people expand their knowledge could greatly help your image as a professional artist. It's a practical thing that people who pass knowledge easily and comprehensively, are more suitable candidates for leading positions in the industry.

So companies may reach out for you. And when they do, negotiate professionally. Choose your words carefully, weigh every word before you say it. Specifically be realistic and clear about deadlines and payment terms, as these two would be the most important factors for either side; considering the quality is already reached upon an agreement.

##### Merchandise and Personal Branding

_\~Direct Business_

This business model is usually for people with a distinct design, or bold personal brand. The variety on this one could be really interesting, some creative hoodie design based on your artworks, designs and brand could be really nice! On the other hand a mug designed to make people feel better while they enjoy their break, is also nice. It's about how well you could handle the marketing, managing production, and designing your works properly.

Try to balance everything carefully in this one, since you are directly working with people and fans, so one bad step and it could all go wrong. But in successful cases, it's a whole career for some artists around the world.
