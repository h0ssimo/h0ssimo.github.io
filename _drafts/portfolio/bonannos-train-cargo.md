This is my latest personal project that I've been developing for a while.

A special deluxe private cargo train nicknamed "IL DORATO - the golden,"  that belongs to Bonanno family in New York, 1901. The Bonanno crime family is one of the "Five Families" who dominate organized crime activities in New York and even generally are considered to be a big part of "American Mafia."
