It's really a good idea to present our characters before going further in the pipeline. This way, the directors in charge, can have a more clear idea of how it's gonna look in the end, and change some stuff if they need to. It's much easier to change stuff at this stage anyways.

In bigger production pipelines, it's a crucial task to check the concepts regularly. However, while it's totally acceptable to even share a ZBrush screenshot, or a quick BPR render, it's more appealing to present the art in style.

One aspect is the materials. Here, I'm gonna go step by step, over how I create cloth material for my concept presentations. Hope it comes handy for you guys as well.

### The Concept Behind This Method

It's really simple: pop out the cloth details, and make a fresnel look in your material. While ZBrush is not a real rendering engine, it has its own tools to help us create what we want.

### Step By Step Guide

OK, so you have your cloth sculpt/simulation imported in ZBrush. Make sure that you have a nice UV layout for your cloth piece. It's only needed for the cloth details, so don't worry if you only need to use the material I'm gonna talk about.
