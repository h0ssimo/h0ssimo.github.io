There have always been discussions on how to do likeness art. Be it drawings or sculpting. Well, first, let me make it clear; it's totally normal to get frustrated when you begin, you're not alone, just learn to deal with it. That's true even for industry-leading artists. It's a hard thing to do after all.

Here, I'm gonna share some of the tips I know from my experience.

* First things first, gather as much references as you can. The more, the better. It's worth it, I'm telling you. Have a special eye on those with harsher shadows. It's gonna help you a lot when it comes to sculpting secondary shapes. Also, normally, you will need front views and a side view. Go for the ones shot with tele lenses (around 100 mm focal length in the best), which kinda flatten the face, and cause less distortion on it.
* Have an eye on the focal length of the camera you're sculpting to. It better be the same as your main references. If you're using ZBrush, there's no real camera in there, but you could change the Angel Of View under the Draw menu. Somewhere around 20 (the default is 50) will do the job. It's worth mentioning that you could try getting your references' EXIF info (camera information) online on websites like [metapicz](http://metapicz.com "metapicz").
