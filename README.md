I'm Hossein Moayed, and this is the resources I used to get my personal website going.
I used Jekyll, and [Massively](https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively-src) theme to get started, and then modified it with the great help of [Mohsen Khanpour](https://github.com/mohsenkhanpour).

Also, if you want to redistribute my content, or use it on your own website, just ask me nicely. :))
