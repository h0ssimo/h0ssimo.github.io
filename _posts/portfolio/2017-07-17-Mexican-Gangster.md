## The Mexican Gangster


I was thinking to try some new real time techniques as a practice before starting this one. I used *Maya* for base mesh, *Mari* for texture, *ZBrush* for sculpting, and *Marmoset Toolbag* for rendering.

## Inspiration

Originally, I came up with this character when I was watching the cool comedian Jeff Ross's show called "Jeff Ross Roasts Criminals." Where he tries to spend some rough, roasting time with the prisoners of the Brazos County Jail. I suggest you watch it if you haven't already.
