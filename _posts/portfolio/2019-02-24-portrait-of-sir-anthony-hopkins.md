These are a couple of unfinished shots of my recent personal project I'm doing in my free time.
I'll be updating this post to share the process from sculpting to rendering. Let me know if you have any questions.

### Workflow

Here I'm gonna quickly go over my process so far.
I've created all my base meshes in _Maya_, even the clothing. Then imported them into _ZBrush_ and started sculpting. At the beginning, I brought in only the head, to stay focused.

The hair and the brows are _FiberMesh_, consisted of multiple setups.
The rendering, is done inside _ZBrush_ as well. I used _BPR_ render passes and combined them in _Photoshop_ with a little touch up.

It's also worth mentioning that I've explained in-depth about the cloth material in _ZBrush_ [here](https://hossimo.com/tutorial/quick-tips-how-to-create-cloth-material-in-zbrush/ "How To Create Cloth Material In ZBrush").

### Rendering Breakdown

This shows my render passes, composed in _Photoshop_:

### What's Next?

I'm almost happy with the head sculpt, but I'm gonna improve it more as I go forward towards rendering. But before that, I'm gonna work on the clothing which I'm not quite happy about.

The hair and the brows are temporary ones, because my plan is to get everything inside _Maya_ and from there, render a realistic portrait of him using _Vray_; so I'm gonna be doing all the hair in _Maya_ using _XGen_. Maybe I will use some of these _FiberMesh_ curves as a base for my _XGen_.
