These are a couple of unfinished shots of my recent personal project I'm doing in my free time.

I'll be updating this post to share the process from sculpting to rendering. Let me know if you have any questions.

### Workflow

Here I'm gonna quickly go over my process so far.

I've created all my base meshes in Maya, even the clothing. Then imported them in ZBrush and started sculpting. At the beginning, I brought in only the head, to stay focused.

The hair and the brows are FiberMesh, consisted of multiple setups.

The rendering, is done inside ZBrush as well. I used BPR render passes and combined them in Photoshop with a little touch up.

It's also worth mentioning that I've explained in-depth about the cloth material in ZBrush [here](https://hossimo.com/tutorial/quick-tips-how-to-create-cloth-material-in-zbrush/ "How To Create Cloth Material In ZBrush").

### Rendering Breakdown

This shows my render passes, composed in Photoshop:

### What's Next?

I'm almost happy with the head sculpt, but I'm gonna improve it more as I go forward towards rendering. But before that, I'm gonna work on the clothing which I'm not quite happy about.

The hair and the brows are temporary ones, because my plan is to get everything inside Maya and from there, render a realistic portrait of him using Vray; so I'm gonna be doing all the hair in Maya using XGen. Maybe I will use some of these FiberMesh curves as a base for my XGen.
