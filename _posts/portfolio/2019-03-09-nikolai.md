The _ZBrush 2019_ version is awesome with a lot of cool features like _NPR_ (Non-Photorealistic Rendering), _Real Cameras_, _Subtool Folder Organization_, and many more. Make sure you check it out.

Also I got a bit far from my ordinary works, and did this one in a more stylized fashion. Hope you guys like it.

I didn't use any Photoshop work on these two, except for my signature. These are mere ZBrush shots.

The images below, show the model I used in combination with ZBrush's NPR to get the results above.
