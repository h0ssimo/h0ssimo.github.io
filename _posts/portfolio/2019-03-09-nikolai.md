excerpt: I did this quick project based on a sketch by Johannes Helgeson, just to
  test out some of Pablo Munoz Gomez's cool brushes, and also to test the ZBrush 2019's
  new NPR (Non-Photorealistic Rendering) feature.

The _ZBrush 2019_ version is awesome with a lot of cool features like _NPR_, _Real Cameras_, _Subtool Folder Organization_, and many more. Make sure you check it out.

Also I got a bit far from my ordinary works, and did this one in a more stylized fashion. Hope you guys like it.

I didn't use any Photoshop work on these two, except for my signature. These are mere ZBrush shots.

The image below, shows the model I used in combination with ZBrush's NPR to get the results above.
