## The Throat Cutter - Argonian Assassin
  

This is the second character in my series of character design for my personal story. He is sneaky and fast. He has his own methods of taking lives, and his cold blood definitely makes him a natural born killer.

## Background

  

His father was killed by an orc in a historical battlefield, so he had to steal stuff just to stay alive. He had no other choice but becoming perfect in doing what it takes to stay safe, at least for a while: *Stealing*, and *Killing*

Years later, he tried to take the lead of his people, and so did he. He had his father in mind, as a personal motivations and also he had the power of taking care of stuff neatly to become the leader.

Now, there is the perfect opportunity for him to do something he waited his whole life for, to take revenge, as well as conquering what his people desperately need: *Water*! Rumors have it that if he takes out the orcs' leader, enough water sources will be right at their possition. So the hunt begins!
