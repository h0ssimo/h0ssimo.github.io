## Young And Wild

I started this project a while ago, knowing that it's meant to be 3D printed, I chose the following pipline.

The base mesh and posing were done in Maya. Then I brought the model to ZBrush, in order to add some details and refine the pose. Also I sculpted the hair from scratch in ZBrush.

Then I dynameshed the whole model with the right resolution, and further tweaked it for 3D printing.
