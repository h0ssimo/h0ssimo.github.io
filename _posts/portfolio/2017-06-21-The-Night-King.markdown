## The Night King

This is a cool character from the *"Game of Thrones"* series. Whenever he appeared on the screen, he gave me chills , so I tried to face my fears by sculpting his head! <br />
I also like what they have done in terms of design, and character look development. That's some great stuff from HBO.
