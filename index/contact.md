## Get to Know Me


Currently working in big-studio production environment as Look Development (Texturing, Shading) and Lighting artist. I'm very well aware of texturing and shading pipelines, for both VFX and Animation, and could adapt to any pipeline, fast. I'm also heavily reliable when it comes to working technically neat to fulfill production standards.

I also enjoy working on characters as well as look development, and have production experience in both animation and game pipelines as Character Artist.

I love to write on my personal blog whenever possible.
