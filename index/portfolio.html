              <p>Characters are really my passion, so whenever I get some free time, I jump into Zbrush!
                I usually share my personal works, maybe some time later I'd share some stuff I do at work.

            </header>

							Here you can check out some of my personal artworks I did in my free time. I try to inspire myself by watching movies, TV series, playing video games, and even listening to music.
							Also seeing what other artists do online, sometimes lead to some great inspirations as well.
						<p>
						</p>
							I have included more shots of each work as well as some information about both how I got inspired to do each one and the characters themselves. You can check out my Artstation for higher resolution images.
							There are a lot of stuff I wanna do yet, so stay tuned.
